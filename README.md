# POPI-HN: Pareto Optimal Prediction Intervals with Hypernetworks

POPI-HN is a hypernetwork-based model for probabilistic forecasting, which can obtain a complete set of solutions for the coverage-width trade-off (Pareto front) of Prediction Intervals. POPI-HN does not require to tune additional parameters, and it has been designed to deal with deep networks.
